# odin-recipes
This project is a basic recipes website. This is the first project that TOP assigned to me.
## Skills
For this website, I'll use the skills and knowledge I've learned about HTML and git in the first lessons in the Foundations course. I will practice committing to GitHub using git in CLI, following the guidelines for a good commit. I'm very excited!!!
