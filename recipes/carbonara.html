        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe will teach you how a nice plate of <em>spaghetti alla carbonara</em> is done in the Roman traditional way.</p>

        <h3>A bit of history</h3>
            <p>The carbonara's origins have been attributed to Cecilia Monti, a noblewoman from Polesine, who used to host meetings of
            the <em><strong>carboneria</strong></em>, a network of secret revolutionary societes.<br>However, it is also said that Roman people discovered
            the recipe from the Allied forces deployed on the Reinhard Line during WW2: they had the opportunity to taste the <em>cacio e ova</em>
            from Abruzzo and modified it by adding <em>guanciale</em>.</p>

        <h3>How it is done</h3>
            <p><strong>Food serves the purpose of satisfying our hunger, and pleasing our palate</strong>. We won't assume there's a "historically correct"
            way of cooking this recipe, neither will we accuse anyone of blasphemy. Partisanship in kitchen is petulant and ultimately detrimental to
            cooking as a form of human expression.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <p>Portioning for four people:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>400g pasta (aforementioned spaghetti, or <em>mezze maniche</em>, <em>bucatini</em>);</li>
                <li>200g Roman <em>pecorino;</em></li>
                <li>black pepper;</li>
                <li>salt;</li>
                <li>280g <em>guanciale</em>;</li>
                <li>5 yolks.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil a pot of water. You won't need much salt, as the <em>pecorino</em> is already very tasty. Add pasta to water.</li>

            <li>Get rid of the <em>guanciale</em>'s rind, then cut it in thick strips. Let it simmer in a pan, on moderate flame, 
            until the fat gets translucid. No oil needed.</li>

            <li>Take a bowl, add the yolks and mix with <em>pecorino</em> and black pepper. Add some of the <em>guanciale</em>'s fat to
            make this mix creamy and dense.</li>

            <li>Keep some cooking water, then drain the pasta when it is <em>al dente</em> (a little hard on the teeth). Add pasta, the creamy mix
            and the cooking water in the <em>guanciale</em>'s pan, and mix thoroughly.</li>

            <li>Decorate with some <em>pecorino</em>, strips of <em>guanciale</em> and some black pepper. Here it is! You <em>carbonara</em> is done,
            as they prepare it in old Roman osterias.</li>
        </ol>
